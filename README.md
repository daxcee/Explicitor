Explicitor by Justin Brower
==========

Explicitor allows a user to scan through the lyrics of his entire iTunes library (without having lyrics within the mp3 files) and search for profanity or other words. This is useful in the event that a DJ or Music Provider should need a means of searching for profanity-free songs. Explicitor provides many features for searching and organizing the data it produces, including a save and load feature. See "User Guide.pdf" for more details.
